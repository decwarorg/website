# favicon pains

for some reason favicon.ico by itself works ok local, but not deployed remote.

DO THIS have a favicon-32x32.png and favicon-16x16.png. https://realfavicongenerator.net/ is good but gives favicon-96x96.png. just make two copies and rename them. all three are 96x96 but it seems to work ok.
